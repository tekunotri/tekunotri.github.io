        <p>hey, i'm <span style="color: #ff003f">techno</span>, a guy who mainly just does random tf2/osu stuff in the internet</p>
        <p>i'm not a very intresting person, but alongside tf2 i also enjoy rhythm games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novels</a> and tinkering with stuff on the computer once in a while</p>
        <p>(that's why this website exists)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>tf2-wise, i've been playing since 2013, and have been making huds/hud edits since 2020</p>

        <p>i also peaked decently high at osu at some point (#2500 in 2020) and played for portugal in owc sometimes (2020, 2022)</p>

    <div id="about website" class="tabcontent">
        <p>this website is a heavy wip, and is mostly just a place for me to dump stuff i've worked on, or just random stuff i feel like putting here</p>
        <p>it's also a place for me to practice web development, as i'm not very good at it</p>
        <p>it's also written straight up rawdogging html/css with like 12 lines of js code to make the tabs work</p>
